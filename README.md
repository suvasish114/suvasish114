I'm a computer science grad student, doing my `M.Sc` from `Kolkata`. I am a highly motivated versatile person, bringing proficient knowledge of multiple programming languages and frameworks including `C/C++`, `Python`, `Tensorflow`, `Flask`, etc. I have a particular research interest in `Deep Learning`. I like designing & building products that positively impact the lives of users. I don't associate myself with specific tools and technology. This mindset has helped me be a quick learner and concentrate more on solving the problem at hand.
